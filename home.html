        <p><strong>Series description:</strong><br><br>
        Salem, Massachusetts — built on blood, secrets, and the cries of the forgotten. Underneath its history of witch trials and slavery, a new kind of power was born. The descendants of the broken rose from the ashes — turning pain into power, and curses into crowns. Vampires. Witches. Panthers. Three bloodlines bound by survival, loyalty, and revenge.
        <br><br>
        King Pierce is a Panther — a shapeshifter whose gift only wakes when death calls his name before twenty-one. He’s from the concrete — raised by struggle, shaped by loyalty, and haunted by what he’s lost. Xzatalia, an original vampire, walks with centuries in her veins and heartbreak on her lips. Cursed by a man who once swore to love her, she’s been running from his shadow ever since — until she finds King.
        <br><br>
        Their connection is fire and war. Love and death. It’s that kind of love that don’t fade, even when blood hits the floor.
        Deja — witch-born, carrying the pain of her ancestors from Salem’s first burnings — steps into a legacy that’s been calling her name since before she was born.
        <br><br>
        In this world, history breathes through blood.
        Every curse has a heartbeat.
        And every love story leaves a scar.
        <br><br>
        Panthers & Vampires blends the raw soul of the streets with the myth of the supernatural — a story about power, loyalty, and love that refuses to die.
        Because even monsters remember where they come from.
